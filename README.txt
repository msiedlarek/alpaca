alpaca
======

Alpaca is a software error aggregator based on ZeroMQ transport layer.
Multiple reporters (such as https://github.com/msiedlarek/alpaca-django)
publish detected problems to a central monitoring server using flexible
API. Monitoring server (monitor) shares its database with a web
application (frontend), allowing detailed inspection of each problem.
